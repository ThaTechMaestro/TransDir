# TransDir
## Goal
This project simulates one of the daily problems encountered by a Systems Administrator while solving it using scripts.

## Overview
A perl script to perform transversing operations in a directory to locate a particular file considering a particular scenario.

---

Lets set the scenario to make solving this problem interesting and understanding the practical importance of the solution.

---

## Scenario
* You are a Systems Administrator working at Company X
* You have a directory which contains a long list of different files, lets say about a 1000 files
* You need to find a file named core.txt in this directory
* You could use linux commands to locate the file but to improve your scripting skills, you decided to write a script to perform this operation and you chose Perl.

# Importance
* Learnt how to write a script using Perl
* Solved a practical problem with perl

# Note!
* To utilise the script, edit the variables such as **$DIR** and **$name** to suit your needs
* **Run** the script with : *perl file_transverse.pl*
